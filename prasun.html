    <p> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are <b>organized</b> and <i>single</i>, and are all related to a
        topic.
        <br>
        Almost
        every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.<br> This
        is
        because
        paragraphs show a reader where the <u>subdivisions</u> of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see
        the
        organization
        of the essay and grasp its main points.
